# Game Launcher
The Game Launcher is a Windows application that streamlines the management of your gaming library by using AI to detect games in a specified folder and allowing you to effortlessly add, remove, and launch games from a centralized location. It is packaged as a standalone executable for easy use and distribution.

## Features
- Add games to the launcher by selecting their executable files.
- Use AI to automatically detect and add games from specified folders.
- Remove unwanted games from the list with ease.
- Quickly launch your favorite games.

### Note:
- Deleting the `games.pkl` file would remove all the games from the launcher.
- Deleting the `icon.png` file would result in crashing of the launcher. To fix this:
	1. Copy and paste the `games.pkl` file somewhere safe.
	2. Re-install the *Game Launcher* app.
	3. Now move the copied `games.pkl` in the installed directory.
